# 📊 Horror Movies Data Engineering Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a complete Data Engineering pipeline built to process and analyze a horror movies dataset.  
It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow using **Apache Airflow**, **Docker**, and data processing techniques to extract, transform, and validate data.

The pipeline automates data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and orchestration of tasks to produce a final clean dataset ready for analysis.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Apache Airflow  
- Docker  
- Python (Pandas)  
- SQL / Data Warehousing concepts  
- Git & GitHub

---

## ⚡ Big Data Processing Layer (Spark + HDFS + YARN)

To simulate a real-world Big Data environment, the pipeline is designed to conceptually integrate the following technologies:

### 🔥 Apache Spark
Apache Spark is used for distributed data processing and transformation of the raw movies dataset.  
It handles large-scale data cleaning, aggregation, and feature engineering in a parallel computing environment.

Example operations:
- Data filtering and cleaning at scale
- Genre parsing and normalization
- Aggregations on ratings and votes

---

### 📦 HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
HDFS is considered as the storage layer for raw and processed data in a distributed environment.

- Raw dataset is stored in HDFS
- Cleaned dataset is written back to HDFS
- Enables fault-tolerant and scalable storage

---

### ⚙️ YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
YARN is used as the cluster resource manager to:

- Allocate resources for Spark jobs
- Manage job scheduling and execution
- Ensure efficient distributed processing

---

### 🧠 Integration with Airflow
Airflow acts as the orchestration layer that triggers Spark jobs and manages the full pipeline workflow:

Airflow → Spark Jobs → HDFS Storage → Final Output

---

### 📌 Note
In this project, Spark, HDFS, and YARN are integrated at a conceptual / architectural level to demonstrate a real-world Big Data pipeline design.

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The pipeline follows a standard ETL workflow:

- **Extract** → Load raw movies dataset  
- **Transform** → Clean missing values, normalize columns, handle duplicates, format features  
- **Load** → Store processed data into final output dataset  
- **Orchestration** → Airflow DAG manages and schedules all tasks  

---

## 🧱 Data Warehouse Schema

The project transforms the raw movies dataset into a simple data warehouse structure:

### 1. fact_movies
Main table containing movie details:
- id (Primary Key)  
- title  
- original_language  
- release_date  
- vote_count  
- vote_average  
- adult  
- status  

---

### 2. dim_genres
Dimension table containing unique genres:
- genre_id (Primary Key)  
- genre_name  

---

### 3. movie_genres_bridge
Bridge table to handle many-to-many relationship between movies and genres:
- movie_id (Foreign Key)  
- genre_id (Foreign Key)  

---

## 🔄 Airflow DAG Workflow

The pipeline includes the following tasks:

- Data extraction  
- Data cleaning  
- Data transformation  
- Data validation  
- Final data loading  

All tasks are executed sequentially using **Airflow DAG orchestration**.

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Start Docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### 2. Start Airflow UI
Open in browser:

```
http://localhost:8081
```

---

### 3. Trigger DAG
- Open Airflow dashboard  
- Enable DAG: `multi_task_pipeline`  
- Trigger manually or wait for schedule  

---

## 📊 Final Output Validation

To ensure data quality and correctness, the following checks were performed:

### ✔ Total & Unique Records
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM movies;
```

### ✔ Check for Duplicate IDs
```sql
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM movies
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### ✔ Rating Validation
```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE vote_average < 0
   OR vote_average > 10;
```
### ✔ Missing Values Check
```
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE title IS NULL
   OR original_language IS NULL
   OR release_date IS NULL
   OR vote_count IS NULL
   OR vote_average IS NULL
   OR adult IS NULL
   OR genre_names IS NULL;
```
